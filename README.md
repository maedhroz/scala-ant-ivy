scala-ant-ivy
=============

Template for an Eclipse-compatible Scala Project

sbt seems to be the standard built tool for Scala projects, but if you want to use Ant, Ivy, and Eclipse together, this should get you going.

Requirements:
- Eclipse
- IvyDE (http://www.apache.org/dist/ant/ivyde/updatesite)
- Scala Plugin for Eclipse (http://download.scala-ide.org/releases-29/stable/site)
